# K-080 — Light-toggle optimistic UI clobbered by stale WS printer_update

## Context

Light-toggle optimistic UI can be clobbered by a stale WS printer_update. toggleLight() writes optimistic DOM but never updates window._printerCache; a WS push that arrives before the fetch resolves snaps the toggle back.

## Plan
<!-- ordered checklist. Prefix steps with the role expected to do them once a card
     has been planned out, e.g. "Implementer: apply config change". -->
1. [ ]

## Signals
<!-- append-only. Leave signals for other agents. Format:
     <!-- signal: <pet-name> <ISO8601-UTC> — <short message> -->
-->
<!-- signal: gentle-loris-hazel 2026-07-16T13:40Z — claiming, root cause already scoped in Context, dispatching implementer directly -->

## Working context
<!-- curated facts a teammate picking this up needs, ~15 lines max. Bigger context
     belongs in a linked doc, not here. -->

## Decision log
<!-- append-only, one line per entry, newest last. Never move this card to done/
     without a line here explaining why. -->

## Handoff notes
<!-- written by whichever role/session was last active on this card, before handing
     off or ending a session. What's half-done, what the next role should do first. -->
